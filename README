Positions And Sizes Only
========================

buffer -> token1.0.position, token1.0.size (.0 = list if there are multiple time the same parser)

Trying to make the parser autogenerate itself ASAP

Parse ABNF?

Use cases:
* Parsing a URL
* Parsing using a rule given from a buffer and not a file
* Parsing DNS binary data
* Parsing a config file?
* HTTP (creating the tokens automatically, no space, lowercase etc.)

Not designed to parse a language.
